## Overview
A top-down interactive personal portfolio in the style of retro pixel games such as Pokemon, Legend of Zelda and Super Mario.
This interactive portfolio project serves as a showcase of my web development and design skills. Built using **Kaboom.js**, a powerful JavaScript framework for creating 2D games, this portfolio allows users to engage with my projects in a playful and immersive way. It features various interactive elements, including a dynamic checklist for tracking objectives, a dialogue system for delivering engaging content, and visual rewards for completed tasks.
